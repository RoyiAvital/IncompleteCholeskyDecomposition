# Sparse Incomplete Cholesky Decomposition

Implementation of the Incomplete Cholesky Decomposition with few methods.  
The project includes a `C` implementation with a MATLAB MEX wrapper.

The aim is to have 3 variants of the incomplete decomposition:

 1.	Threshold (`IC(\tau)`)  
	Using a threshold, $ \tau $ to define which elements will be kept from the decomposition.  
	It can be using global threshold or by a column.  
	**Implemented**
 2.	Pattern (`IC(l)`)
	Filling elements which are up to `l` steps in the graph of the matrix `A`.
	For `l = 0` called *Zero Fill* where filling zeros in elements not defined by the pattern.  
	Also could be filled by a given pattern of sparsity (So given `A` as the pattern it matches `l = 0`).  
	**Not Implemented**
 3. Number of Non Zero Elements (`IC(p)`)  
	Keeps the largest `p` elements per column.  
	**Not Implemented**

## Generating MATLAB MEX

 1.	Download the repository.
 2. Run `MakeMex` in MATLAB with pre defined MATLAB MEX Compiler.
 3.	Go through the Unit Tests and the Run Time Analysis.
 
The MEX Wrapper supports only Sparse Real Matrices of Type Double.

## Performance

Comparing the performance with MATLAB's functions.

The MEX file and MATLAB's `ICT` were the most memory efficient.

## To Do

 *	Move the array sorting related code to a dedicated repository with complete run time analysis.
